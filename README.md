## What the program does
A simple command-line interface shell program that is capable of executing programs by parsing a given string. This shell program is also able to change and print the current working directory.
I helped a student named Joseph Tawil on Slack and shared part of my code with him, specifically the exe function. This is a disclaimer to notify graders and professor Souza in case there are any suspicions.

## List Extra Credit comepleted (if not attempted leave blank)
* (10 - Points) Implement the shell so the current working directory is shown on the prompt.
